    - The concept was first described by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) paradox in 1935.
        - Two opposing views emerged: 
            - Entanglement is paradoxical; therefore, quantum mechanics is incomplete.
            - Entanglement is a real feature of reality.
        - Einstein famously called entanglement *"spooky action at a distance"*.
    - John Stuart Bell published his theorem (Bell's theorem) in 1964, allowing the debate to be tested.
        - **Bell's inequality**: a limit on the correlations that can exist between measurements of two particles if those 
            particles are assumed to be governed by local realism.
        - Starting in the 1970s, experiments on the theorem were conducted, proving quantum entanglement to be a property

    - Most importantly, quantum entanglement has tangible practical uses, mainly in quantum computing:

              from outside threats. 
        - It allows quantum computing to be astronomically faster at solving certain problems.
            - Problems that would take thousands of years with classical computing can take minutes.
            - Computational demand grows at a much slower pace as the complexity of a simulated system increases.

        Shorâ€™s algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. 
        Its power comes from turning a hard classical problem (factoring large numbers) into 
        a problem of finding the period of a modular function, which quantum computers 
        can solve efficiently. In essence it can find the prime factors of large
        integers faster than any known classical algorithm

        1. **Reduction to Period Finding**  
        - To factor an integer N, Shorâ€™s algorithm reduces the problem to finding the 
            period (or order) of the function $f(x) = a^x$ mod N, for some random $a < N$.
        - Once the period r is known, we can often compute the nontrivial factors of N.

        2. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**  
        - The quantum circuit prepares a superposition of many possible values of x.
        - Modular exponentiation entangles these x-values with their outputs f(x).
        - Applying the QFT extracts information about the period r, amplifying 
            measurement outcomes that encode the hidden periodicity.
        - This step specifically is what gives the quantum algorithm an advantage
             over its classical counterparts turning it into having an exponential 
             speedup.
             
        3. **Measurement and Classical Postprocessing**  
        - Measuring the quantum state collapses it to a value strongly correlated with the period.
        - Classical number theory (using the Euclidean algorithm) then turns the period into actual factors of N.

        Entanglement is essential because it correlates each input x (held in superposition) 
        with its modular output f(x). This global correlation ensures that when the QFT is 
        applied, interference across all states reveals the hidden period r. Without entanglement, 
        the algorithm would just produce random samples of f(x) with no usable structure.
